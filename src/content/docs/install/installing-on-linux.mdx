Since the PC version of Modern Warfare 2 was only released on Windows, installing it on Linux is little bit trickier.  

Today, two practical ways exist:

- Through **[Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton)**, Steam’s built-in compatibility layer
- Through a **[custom Wine prefix](https://www.winehq.org/)**, managed by the user

Just like on [Windows](/install/installing-on-windows/), both approaches require IW4x to be installed in the game directory of MW2.

### 1. Using Proton

Steam now enables Proton for Windows-only titles by default.  
This means that, once installed through Steam, Modern Warfare 2 is ready to go with no special configuration required.  
Installing IW4x then only requires downloading and extracting the necessary files into the MW2 Proton directory.

For example, assuming `$STEAMLIBRARY` points to your Steam library, IW4x can be installed with the following commands:

<Steps>

1. **Download `iw4x.dll`**

   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client/releases/latest/download/iw4x.dll -o iw4x.dll
   ```

2. **Download `raw files`**

   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles/releases/latest/download/release.zip -o release.zip
   ```

3. **Extract archive**

    ```bash
    unzip -o release.zip -d "$STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/common/Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2"
    ```

</Steps>

From there, launching Modern Warfare 2 through Steam also launches IW4x, and the Proton layer handles all necessary translations in the background.

### 2. Using Wine Prefix

Others prefer not to rely on Proton’s managed environment. In that case, a dedicated Wine prefix must be created and configured. The process requires several steps, which are described below:

<Steps>

1. **Create a new prefix**

   ```bash
   WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-mw2 wineboot
   ```

2. **Install required runtimes**

   IW4x and Modern Warfare 2 expect a number of Microsoft libraries to be present.  
   These can be installed with `winetricks`:

   ```bash
   WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-mw2 winetricks vcrun2019 d3dcompiler_47 dxvk
   ```

3. **Acquire Modern Warfare 2**

   The game can be installed through Steam running inside that prefix.  
   Or, alternatively, by retrieving the files directly using [`DepotDownloader`](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader):

   ```bash
   ./DepotDownloader -app 10190 -username <username> -password <password>
   ```

4. **Add IW4x**

   With the base game in place, the IW4x files can be downloaded into the prefix’s game directory:

    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client/releases/latest/download/iw4x.dll -o iw4x.dll
    curl -L https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles/releases/latest/download/release.zip -o release.zip
    unzip -o release.zip -d ~/.wine-mw2/drive_c/Program\ Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Call\ of\ Duty\ Modern\ Warfare\ 2
    ```

</Steps>

Once the base game is present and the IW4x files downloaded and extracted, we are ready to run the game.  
All you have to do is invoking Wine explicitly:

```bash title="bash"
WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-mw2 wine iw4x.exe
```

Though more involved, this method grants precise control over the runtime environment, which some users may prefer.
