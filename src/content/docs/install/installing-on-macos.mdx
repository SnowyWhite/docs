IW4x on MacOS has a similar installation process as [Linux](/install/installing-on-linux), but with the additional complexity that Wine must often be wrapped within a managed runtime such as **[CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover)** or **[WineSkin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wineskin/)**.  

The installation steps, ensuring the base MW2 files are present, placing `iw4x.dll` and the `raw files` alongside the executable, and then invoking the new binary, remain conceptually identical.

The result is that IW4x on MacOS is less a separate port than a faithful reproduction of the Windows environment, hosted within a compatibility container. While this may appear circuitous, it underscores IW4xâ€™s neutrality: the project provides only the essential modifications.  

It is this simplicity that makes IW4x portable across different operating systems, even when those systems themselves were never official targets for Modern Warfare 2.
