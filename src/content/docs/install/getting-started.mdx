## Prerequisites

IW4x is not a game on its own. It requires **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)** to be installed.  
If you do not own the game yet, please first buy and install it [**from Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10180/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_2_2009/).  

:::danger[Only Steam Version is supported]
IW4x does not work with pirated copies or the Microsoft Store version!

## How does IW4x work?

When you launch IW4x, it starts a customized version of the game that supports new features and enhancements specific to IW4x.

<details>
<summary>More Details</summary>

At its core, IW4x is made up of two main files: `iw4x.exe` and `iw4x.dll`.  
The executable file, `iw4x.exe`, is the customized version of the original `iw4mp.exe`.  
Unlike the official version, `iw4x.exe` loads the `iw4x.dll` file during startup.  
This DLL file contains the actual functionality of IW4x. It's the output you'll get from compiling the source code, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client).

</details>

By installing IW4x in the same directory as the original Modern Warfare 2 game, itâ€™s able to reuse the base gameâ€™s assets.  
In addition, IW4x introduces extra content such as new maps, weapons, calling cards, and more.  
These additional assets are also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles) and must be installed separately for IW4x to function correctly.

In the next section, weâ€™ll walk you through the installation process step by step.

## Installing on Windows

Installing IW4x manually requires only a few simple steps:

- Find MW2 installation
- Download `iw4x.dll`
- Download `raw files`
- Unpack `raw files`
- Start the game

### 1. Find your Modern Warfare 2 installation

IW4x needs to be installed in the same directory where Modern Warfare 2 is installed.  
It's usually in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2`.  
If you have trouble finding it, the easiest way is to open your Steam Library and then:

- Right-click on **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) - Multiplayer**
- Select **Manage > Browse local files**

This will open the directory where the game is installed.

### 2. Download IW4x

Once you've found your MW2 installation, you can go ahead and download the IW4x DLL file:

<LinkButton
   href="https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client/releases/latest/download/iw4x.dll"
   variant="primary"
   icon="seti:windows"
   iconPlacement="start"
>Download iw4x.dll</LinkButton>

![Download IW4x DLL](../../../assets/img/install/download_iw4x_dll.gif)

Make sure that your game folder now looks like this:

![IW4x Client Files Installed](../../../assets/img/install/installed_iw4x_dll.png)

### 3. Download Raw Files

The [raw files](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles) are additional assets (maps, weapons, scripts. etc.) to make your experience better.  
Like in the previous step, you can simply download the latest release version and save it to your game folder.

<LinkButton
   href="https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles/releases/latest/download/release.zip"
   variant="primary"
   icon="seti:windows"
   iconPlacement="start"
>Download IW4x Raw Files</LinkButton>

The files are compressed in a ZIP archive and need to be extracted first.  
The easiest way to do so is to select the archive and then:

- Click on **Compressed Folder Tools**
- Click on **Extract all**
- Click on **Extract**

Make sure to extract them to the root directory of your game folder (not in an additional `release` sub-folder).

![Download IW4x DLL](../../../assets/img/install/download_iw4x_raw_files.gif)

Make sure that your game folder looks now looks like this:

![IW4x Client Files Installed](../../../assets/img/install/installed_iw4x_raw_files.png)

### 4. Run IW4x

Now you can double-click on `IW4x.exe` and start gaming! ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ®

### PowerShell Commands

:::note[Info]
If you have followed all the previous steps, you can skip what's coming next.  
This is just extra information for those who are experienced with PowerShell.
:::

The steps described above can also be done in the terminal. Make sure to `cd` into the game directory:

```powershell title="PowerShell"
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2"
```

Then you can download `iw4x.dll` and the `raw files`:

```powershell title="PowerShell"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client/releases/latest/download/iw4x.dll -OutFile iw4x.dll
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles/releases/latest/download/release.zip -OutFile iw4x-rawfiles.zip
```

Once downloaded, the only step left is to extract the content of the ZIP archive:

```powershell title="PowerShell"
Expand-Archive iw4x-rawfiles.zip -DestinationPath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2"
```

And if you have some spare time, to delete the downloaded archive:

```powershell title="PowerShell"
Remove-Item iw4x-rawfiles.zip
```
