## Prerequisites

IW4x is not a game on its own. It requires **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)** to be installed.  
If you do not own the game yet, please first buy and install it [**from Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10180/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_2_2009/).  

:::danger[Only Steam Version is supported]
IW4x does not work with pirated copies or the Microsoft Store version!

## How does IW4x work?

When you launch IW4x, it starts a customized version of the game that supports new features and enhancements specific to IW4x.

At its core, IW4x is made up of two main files: `iw4x.exe` and `iw4x.dll`.
The executable file, `iw4x.exe`, is the customized version of the original `iw4mp.exe`.
Unlike the official version, `iw4x.exe` loads the `iw4x.dll` file during startup.  
This DLL contains the actual functionality of IW4x, and it's the output you'll get from compiling the [source code](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client).

By installing IW4x in the same directory as the original Modern Warfare 2 game, it’s able to reuse the base game’s assets.  
In addition, IW4x introduces extra content such as new maps, weapons, calling cards, and more.  
These additional assets are also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles) and must be installed separately for IW4x to function correctly.

## How to Install

Regardless of the operating system you're using — be it Windows, Linux, or MacOS — the basic steps for installing IW4x remain the same. First, locate the directory where Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is installed. Then, download `iw4x.dll` and the `raw files` to the same directory. Unzip the `raw files`, and the game is ready to run!

In the following sections, we will walk you through the installation process for each operating system, step by step.
