:::caution
We strongly **recommend** to use the [IW4x Launcher](https://github.com/iw4x/launcher) described in the [Quickstart Guide](/get-started/quickstart).  
It's the easiest and most reliable way to install and keep IW4x up to date  
However, if you prefer to install IW4x manually, you can follow the steps outlined below.  
**Important**: If you manually install IW4x, you'll need to repeat all of these steps each time a new update is released.
:::

IW4x on MacOS has a similar installation process as [Linux](/get-started/manual-install/linux-guide), but with the additional complexity that Wine must often be wrapped within a managed runtime such as **[CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover)** or **[WineSkin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wineskin/)**.  

The installation steps, ensuring the base MW2 files are present, placing `iw4x.dll` and the `raw files` alongside the executable, and then invoking the new binary, remain conceptually identical.

The result is that IW4x on MacOS is less a separate port than a faithful reproduction of the Windows environment, hosted within a compatibility container. While this may appear circuitous, it underscores IW4x’s neutrality: the project provides only the essential modifications.  

It is this simplicity that makes IW4x portable across different operating systems, even when those systems themselves were never official targets for Modern Warfare 2.
