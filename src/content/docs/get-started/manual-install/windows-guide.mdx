:::caution

We strongly **recommend** to use the [IW4x Launcher](https://github.com/iw4x/launcher) described in the [Quickstart Guide](/get-started/quickstart).  
It's the easiest and most reliable way to install and keep IW4x up to date  
However, if you prefer to install IW4x manually, you can follow the steps outlined below.  
**Important**: If you manually install IW4x, you'll need to repeat all of these steps each time a new update is released.

:::

## 1. Find Modern Warfare 2 installation

IW4x needs to be installed in the same directory where *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2* is installed.
Usually, the path to this directory is:

```cmd
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
```

If you have trouble to find the installation directory, you can use your Steam Library as help:

<Steps>

1. Open Steam and go to your **LIBRARY**

2. Right-click on **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) - Multiplayer**

3. Select **Manage > Browse local files**

   <Video src={find_directory} />

</Steps>

## 2. Download IW4x

Once you've located the Modern Warfare 2 game directory, you can download the latest release version of `iw4x.dll` from the [GitHub](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client) repository and save it to this directory.

<LinkButton
    href="https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client/releases/latest/download/iw4x.dll"
    variant="primary"
    icon="seti:windows"
    iconPlacement="start"
>Download **iw4x.dll**</LinkButton>

<Video src={download_iw4x} />

## 3. Download Raw Files

The [raw files](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles) are additional assets like maps, weapons, and scripts that enhance your IW4x experience.  
Like in the [previous step](#2-download-iw4x), download and save the latest release version into your game directory.

<LinkButton
    href="https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles/releases/latest/download/iw4x.exe"
    variant="primary"
    icon="seti:windows"
    iconPlacement="start"
>Download **iw4x.exe**</LinkButton>

<LinkButton
    href="https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles/releases/latest/download/release.zip"
    variant="primary"
    icon="seti:windows"
    iconPlacement="start"
>Download **release.zip**</LinkButton>

You'll find several more downloads on GitHub, but the most important ones are:

- **iw4x.exe** - A custom version of the original `iw4mp.exe`, designed to load `iw4x.dll` (downloaded in the previous step)
- **release.zip** - Contains all required extra assets for IW4x

Additional files you may encounter:

- `zonebuilder.exe` - A tool for creating custom assets and mods
- `update.json` - Used by the launcher for update tracking, can be ignored
- Several files with the `.iwd` extension (e.g. `iw4x_00.iwd`)

The `.iwd` files contain optional DLC content, including Nuketown from *Call of Duty: Black Ops (2010)* and the classic maps from *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2007)*.  

IW4x will work without them, but you can download them too if you want to play on these DLC maps.  
Just make sure to move them into the `iw4x/` directory, or the game won't recognize them.

The `iw4x/` directory doesn't exist yet, that's because the files in **release.zip** need to be extracted first.  
The easiest way to do so is to select **release.zip** and then:

<Steps>

1. Click on **Compressed Folder Tools**

2. Click on **Extract all**

3. Click on **Extract**

   Make sure to extract them to the root directory of your game folder (not in an additional `release` sub-folder).

4. Delete **release.zip**

</Steps>
