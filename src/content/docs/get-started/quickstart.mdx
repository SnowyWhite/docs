## Prerequisites

IW4x is not a game on its own. It requires **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)** to be installed.  
If you do not own the game yet, please first buy and install it [**via Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10180/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_2_2009/).  

:::danger[Important Compatibility Notice]
As of 2025, *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2* is also available via the Microsoft Store.  
**Please note**: IW4x is **not compatible** with this version. Only the **latest Steam version** of the game is supported.

Additionally, we frequently see issues caused by pirated copies, including bugs and crashes.  
We do **not support** pirated versions and will offer **no assistance** for them.
:::

Iw4x needs to be installed in the same directory where *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2* is installed.  
Usually, the path to this directory is:

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
  ```cmd
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
  ```sh
   $STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/common/Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="MacOS" icon="apple">
  ```sh
   ~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
  ```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Finding your Modern Warfare 2 installation

If you have trouble to find the install directory, you can use your Steam Library as help:

<Steps>

1. Open Steam and go to your **LIBRARY**

2. Right-click on **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) - Multiplayer**

3. Select **Manage > Browse local files**

    <Video src={find_directory} />

</Steps>

## Verifying Game Integrity

Before installing IW4x, it's a good idea to verify the integrity of your game files through Steam.  
This prevents errors such as `ERROR: Could not find zone 'code_pre_gfx_mp.ff'`, when launching IW4x.

<Steps>

1. Open Steam and go to your **LIBRARY**

2. Right-click on **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) - Multiplayer**

3. Select **Properties...**

4. Select **Installed Files**

5. Click the button **Verify integrity of game files**

    <Video src={verify_integrity} />

</Steps>

Steam will check that all game files are intact and properly installed. If it finds anything missing or corrupted, it will automatically re-download the necessary files.

## Installing IW4x

Once you've located the Modern Warfare 2 game directory, you are ready install IW4x.  
The simplest way is by using the IW4x launcher, which will download and install all required files automatically.

<Steps>

1. Get the launcher from [GitHub](https://github.com/iw4x/launcher)

    <LinkButton href="https://github.com/iw4x/launcher/releases/latest/download/iw4x-launcher.exe" variant="primary" icon="seti:windows" iconPlacement="start">**Download for Windows**</LinkButton>
    <LinkButton href="https://github.com/iw4x/launcher/releases/latest/download/iw4x-launcher-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz" variant="primary" icon="linux" iconPlacement="start">**Download for Linux**</LinkButton>

2. Move it into your Modern Warfare 2 directory

3. Double-click the launcher to start the installation

    <Video src={download_launcher} />

</Steps>

:::caution[Windows protected your PC]
Windows may display a warning the first time you run **iw4x-launcher.exe**.  
This happens simply because the file isn't commonly seen on Windows systems (**not** because it's unsafe).  
It's completely normal behavior and the launcher is safe to use.  
If you see the warning, you can safely click on **`More info`** and then **`Run anyway`**.

(And yes, the warning can be removed, but it requires a Microsoft code-signing certificate, which costs a lot of money.)
:::

## Using the Launcher

:::note
We recommend using the launcher every time you play IW4x.  
It will automatically download any updates and provides additional customization options.
:::

Once you've installed IW4x, you should see the following folder and files in your game directory:

<FileTree>
- `Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2`
  - iw4x/
  - **launcher**
    - cache.json
    - **config.json**
    - log.log
  - iw4x.exe
  - iw4x-launcher.exe
  - ... other files and folders
</FileTree>

If you open **config.json** in a text editor (such as Notepad), you'll see something like this:

```json title="launcher/config.json"
{
  "update_only": false,
  "skip_self_update": false,
  "force_update": false,
  "args": "-stdout",
  "offline": false,
  "testing": false,
  "disable_art": false,
  "dxvk": false
}
```

These are configuration values you can adjust to suit your preferences (more details about each option on [GitHub](https://github.com/iw4x/launcher#%EF%B8%8F-command-line-arguments)).  
The most important part is the `"args"` configuration: The arguments you add there will be used whenever you start the game via launcher.  

For example, if you want to play offline against bots using the [Bot Warfare Mod](https://github.com/ineedbots/iw4_bot_warfare), you could set `"args"` like this:

```diff lang="json" ins=" -disable-mod-unloading +set fs_game mods/mp_bots"
{
  "args": "-stdout -disable-mod-unloading +set fs_game mods/mp_bots",
  "offline": false,
  "testing": false,
  "disable_art": false,
  "dxvk": false
}
```

Now, each time you launch the game via the launcher, it will automatically load the mod!
