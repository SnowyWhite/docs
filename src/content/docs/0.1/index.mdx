With IW4x, you have:

* **Dedicated Servers** Browse and play on servers hosted by community members
* **Modding Support** Play custom game modes like Gun Game or Infected (or create your own!)
* **Controller Support** Use your Xbox, PS4, or other controllers in the game (no extra software required)
* **More Content** Maps and Weapons from other Call of Duty titles are included right out of the box
* **Bot Warfare** Play against smart and configurable bots, either online or in private match
