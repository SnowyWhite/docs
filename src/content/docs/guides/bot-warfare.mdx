## Installing Bot Warfare

There are two ways to install the mod. Each method has its own pros and cons:

            <li>Everyone starts at rank 1</li>
            <li>Progression is specific to this mod</li>
            <li>Classes are specific to this mod</li>
        </ul>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Script Installation" icon="seti:powershell">
        <ul>
            <li>Loads automatically with private matches and dedicated servers</li>
            <li>No installation required for other players</li>
            <li>Uses your normal stats and classes</li>
        </ul>
    </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Mod Installation

<Steps>
    
    1. Navigate to your **IW4x installation directory**
    
    2. **Open** the **mods** folder (create it if it doesn't exist)
    
    3. **Extract** the **mp_bots** folder from the downloaded `.zip` archive into the **mods** folder

</Steps> 

<Video src={mod_installation} />

Your folder structure should now look like this:

<FileTree>
    - `Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2`
        - iw4x/
        - launcher/
        - main/
        - miles/
        - **mods/**
            - **mp_bots/**
                - scriptdata/
                    - waypoints/
                - z_svr_bots.iwd
            - ...
        - players/
        - userraw/
        - zone/
</FileTree>

---

### Script Installation

<Steps>
    
    1. Navigate to your **IW4x installation directory**

    2. **Open** the **userraw** folder (create it if it doesn't exist)

    3. **Extract** the **scriptdata** folder and the **z_svr_bots.iwd** file from the downloaded `.zip` archive into **userraw**

</Steps> 

<Video src={script_installation} />

You should now have the following folder structure:

<FileTree>
    - `Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2`
        - iw4x/
        - launcher/
        - main/
        - miles/
        - mods/
        - players/
        - **userraw/**
            - scriptdata/
                - waypoints/
            - z_svr_bots.iwd
            - ...
        - zone/
</FileTree>

## Using Bot Warfare

If you installed it using the [mod version](#mod-installation), you'll need to manually load it from the in-game `Mods` menu.  
You'll know the mod is active when you see `Mod: mods/mp_bots` in the top-left corner of the main menu:

<Video src={load_mod} />

### Running on a Dedicated Server

Set the `fs_game` dvar to `mods/mp_bots` when launching the server:

```bash
iw4x.exe -dedicated +fs_game mods/mp_bots
```

You can customize the bot behavior in your server config.  
A full list of configurable settings is available in the [Bot Warfare README](https://github.com/ineedbots/iw4_bot_warfare?tab=readme-ov-file#dvars).

### In-Game Menu

In private matches, press `5` (default key for `actionslot 2`) to open the Bot Warfare menu.  
To change this keybind:

<Steps>

    1. Go to `Options` -> `Controls` -> `Look`

    2. Change the `Look Down` keybinding

        ![mod_key](@/assets/img/botwarfare/mod_key.png)
    
</Steps>

Once in a private match, open the menu to spawn bots or tweak the settings.
