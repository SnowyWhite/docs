:::danger[Important]

If your version of the game has a [region lock](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/58D3-B80D-2943-3CC6), you won't be able to change the language!

:::

## Change Steam Settings

If IW4x is installed in the **same** directory as your Steam version, you only need to follow the steps below.  
If it's installed in a **different** directory, please also refer to the additional steps further below.

<Steps>

1. Open Steam and go to your **LIBRARY**

2. Right-click on **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) - Multiplayer**

3. Select **Properties...**

4. In the **General** tab, find the **Language** section

5. Click on the drop-down menu and select your desired language

</Steps>

After changing the language, Steam will download the necessary files for the chosen option.  
Once the download is complete, you can launch IW4x and enjoy the game in your preferred setting!

Please note that downloading new language files can take a while, depending on your internet connection.

## Different Install Location

If IW4x is installed separately from your Steam version, you'll need to manually copy the language files.  
Refer to the [section above](#change-steam-settings) for instructions on how to acquire them.

### Files to Copy

Make sure to copy the following files and folders from your Steam installation:

- The file `localization.txt`
- The folder `main/video/`
- The folder `zone/<language>/` (e.g., `zone/russian/` for Russian)
- All files named `localized_<language>_iw##.iwd` in the `main/` folder (e.g., `localized_russian_iw00.iwd` for Russian)

#### File Structure Overview

<FileTree>
- `Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2`
  - main
    - **video**
      - *.bik all files
    - **localized_\<language\>_iw00.iwd** 
    - **..** All `.iwd` files for the selected language
    - **localized_\<language\>_iw##.iwd**
  - zone
    - **\<language\>/**
      - *.ff all files
  - **localization.txt**
</FileTree>

### Files to Remove

By now, your `main` folder should contain `localized_<language>_iw##.iwd` files for **both** your newly selected language and the one you were using before.
If you launch the game at this point, you might see an error like this:

![Couldn't load image 'specialty_new_nonenglish'](@/assets/img/language/error_message.png)

To fix it, you'll need to take action on the files from the **previous language**.  
You can choose one of the following:

- **Rename them** - For example, add `.bak` to the end: `localized_english_iw00.iwd` -> `localized_english_iw00.iwd.bak`
- **Move them** - e.g., create a folder named `english` next to `main` and move the files there
- **Delete them entirely**

Which method to use is up to you. The key is that the `main` folder only contains files for **one language**.

### Example: Russian Language

If you want to add Russian as a new language, copy the following from your Steam version to the same relative paths in your IW4x folder:

<FileTree>
- `Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2`
  - main
    - **video/**
    - **localized_russian_iw00.iwd**
    - **localized_russian_iw01.iwd**
    - **localized_russian_iw02.iwd**
    - **localized_russian_iw03.iwd**
    - **localized_russian_iw04.iwd**
    - **localized_russian_iw05.iwd**
    - **localized_russian_iw06.iwd**
    - **localized_russian_iw07.iwd**
    - **localized_russian_iw08.iwd**
  - zone
    - **russian/**
  - **localization.txt**
</FileTree>
